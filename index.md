## A12: Tackling Distribution Shifts via Test-Time Adaptation and Optimization, Jun-Kun Wang

### 1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
The most interesting topic covered in the domain is the applications the test-time adaptation framework can have on real-world systems. Variance between training and testing data is not uncommon to observe in machine learning settings, so I find it fascinating that methods are being researched to address this to help ensure more generalizable models.

### 2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
A potential investigation I'd like to further pursue in the Quarter 2 Project is the application of biomedical data when working with our improved framework. I want to look specifically into chronic illness medical diagnosis data to see if our ideas effect classification/diagnosis rates in any way.

### 3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
A potential change I would make to the approach taken in the current Quarter 1 Project is to use different datasets to observe the performance of test-time adaptation in different domains. This quarter, our experiments were limited to only CIFAR image datasets.

### 4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
Techniques I would be interested in using in my project would be to manually augment my own image data. I feel that developing that technique would be beneficial for improved experimental setup and replication in this domain.
